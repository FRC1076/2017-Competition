    /* Explanation of forward tests
     * Get up and walk very slowly. Now, start to turn left. You'll notice that your RIGHT foot
     * travels a longer distance and that your LEFT foot does not. In fact, you can turn on the spot
     * purely by swinging your right foot while keeping your left foot still. The opposite is true for
     * turning right.
     * 
     * This suggests that preventing this turn is accomplished by either speeding up the slow foot 
     * (left foot for left turn, right foot for right turn), or by slowing the fast foot (right foot for 
     * left turn, left foot for right turn). We choose to slow the fast foot as this is always achievable 
     * (if you turn at your maximum foot speed, you can't speed up any faster!). We also decide NOT to change
     * the slow foot, as this reduces speed needlessly.
     * 
     * TLDR: Slow the motor opposite to your drift direction

     * drift RIGHT. Your nose should point to the right of wherever you were pointed at before.

     * (Another way to thing about this is that when you turn 180 degrees, everything that was
     * on your left is now on your right and vice versa)

     * Thus, to prevent drift, you must reduce the speed of the motor on the SAME side as the drift
